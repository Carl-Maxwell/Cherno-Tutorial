These are some general style guidelines for this project.

# General
- Try to keep lines under 80 characters.
- Delete, don't comment out.

# Identifiers
- Class identifiers are capitalized CamelCase (like VertexBuffer)
- Methods & functions are uncapitalized camelCase (like )
- Variables are lower case snake_case (like index_buffer_obj)
- Member variables are prefixed with "m_" (like m_renderer_id)
- namespaces are lowercase
- acronyms:
  - Acronyms in class names should be uppercase (RNG not rng)
  - Acronyms elsewhere should be lowercase (rng not RNG)


# Other
- filenames are lowercase snake case
- Two space spaces-as-tabs
- Don't use an empty line at the beginning or end of scopes
- Do use one empty line between methods, blocks and conditionals in the same scope.
- Do not use more than one empty line anywhere.

# Comments

```c++
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Heading 1
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

//
// Heading 2
//

// Heading 3

// body text lorem ipsum dolor set amet
//   lorem ipsum so on and so forth more body text
```

- Heading sizes 1 and 2 have an empty line before and after them
  - Unless they're at the beginning or end of a scope block.
